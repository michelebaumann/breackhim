## OSINT

The best ways of doing so is by inspecting my "public" presence on the internet, such as:

- Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/hihey54
- Twitter: https://twitter.com/g_apru
- Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/@hihey54
- LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/giovanniapruzzese
- Personal Webpage: https://www.giovanniapruzzese.com/

Each "word" corresponds to something related to myself. Specifically:

- a "word" corresponds to an event that shocked me on April 18th, 2023
- a "word" is the first name of my current partner
- a "word" corresponds to the title of a video game I used to play very often as a teenager
- a "word" is the date in which I came to know of the existence of baniwis (format: ddmmyyyy)
