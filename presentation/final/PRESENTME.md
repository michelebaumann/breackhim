# CHALLENGE #1

You have been given four password protected zipped archives. Can you crack the password?

**DESCRIPTION**

On Moodle, you will find a folder ("challenge_1", see here) containing 4 zipped archives. Each of these archives is protected with a password that is "related" to Giovanni Apruzzese -- i.e., me.
To discover the password (unless you're a psychic) you must "gather information" about myself.
