**and it didn't work...**

## unit testing

1. Test "shared" word combinations

- 4 files 4 words:

```python
date    =   {a}
event   =   {b}
game    =   {c}
partner =   {d}
```

- 1 file 12 words:

```python
dictionary    =   { a_b,
                    a_c,
                    a_d,
                    b_a,
                    a_c,
                    b_d,
                    c_a,
                    c_b,
                    c_d,
                    d_a,
                    d_b,
                    d_c
                    }
```

2. Test let combinations

```python
.   a   b   c   d   total
a   0   9   6   6   21
b   9   0   6   6   21
c   6   6   0   4   16
d   6   6   4   0   16
total               74
```

**HELL YESS**
